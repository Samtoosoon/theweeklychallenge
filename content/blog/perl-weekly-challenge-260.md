## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #260` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Did I tell you that I submitted `The Weekly Challenge` project to the upcoming `Outreachy Program` sponsored by `TPRF`?

Well, it is first time for us. Last week, we started getting response from applicants of the program. They have already started working on the project. The plan is move the current static website to realtime interactive website. For this we are using `Dancer2` web framework with `MySQL` as the database. For frontend we are using `HTML`, `JavaScript` and `Bootstrap`.

If you have any suggestion to improve the user experience then please do share with us.

Working with interns have been great so far. They are all full of energy and ready to take on challenge. I just guide them when they are stuck.

## Task 1: Unique Occurrences {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers, `@ints`.

Write a script to return 1 if the number of occurrences of each value in the given array is unique or 0 otherwise.

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (1,2,2,1,1,3)
    Output: 1

    The number 1 occurred 3 times.
    The number 2 occurred 2 times.
    The number 3 occurred 1 time.

    All occurrences are unique, therefore the output is 1.

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (1,2,3)
    Output: 0

#### Example 3

    Input: @ints = (-2,0,1,-2,1,1,0,1,-2,9)
    Output: 1

<br>

## Task 2: Dictionary Rank {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mark Anderson](https://github.com/andemark)
***

You are given a word, `$word`.

Write a script to compute the dictionary rank of the given word.

#### Example 1

    Input: $word = 'CAT'
    Output: 3

    All possible combinations of the letters:
    CAT, CTA, ATC, TCA, ACT, TAC

    Arrange them in alphabetical order:
    ACT, ATC, CAT, CTA, TAC, TCA

    CAT is the 3rd in the list.
    Therefore the dictionary rank of CAT is 3.

#### Example 2

    Input: $word = 'GOOGLE'
    Output: 88

#### Example 3

    Input: $word = 'SECRET'
    Output: 255
